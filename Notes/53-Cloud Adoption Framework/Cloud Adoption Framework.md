# Azure Cloud Adoption Framework

The **Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)** is a collection of **best practices, tools, and guidance** to help organizations successfully adopt Azure.

---

## Purpose

- Helps both **beginners and experienced teams** understand **what to do**, **when**, and **why** when adopting cloud technologies.
- Provides a **structured lifecycle** approach for digital transformation.

---

## Key Focus

- Provides **clarity and direction** for organizations navigating the complexities of:
  - Governance (RBAC, policies, tagging)
  - Strategy
  - Management
  - Modernization

---

## Core Lifecycle Stages

1. **Define Strategy**
   - Align cloud efforts with **business goals** and motivations.
   - Understand drivers such as **growth**, **cost reduction**, or **agility**.

2. **Plan**
   - Assess **current digital estate**.
   - Identify **skills gaps**.
   - Define the **cloud adoption plan**.

3. **Ready**
   - Prepare the environment.
   - Establish foundational elements like **landing zones**, networking, identity, and compliance controls.

4. **Adopt**
   - **Migrate** workloads to Azure.
   - **Innovate** using cloud-native capabilities (AI, serverless, containers).

5. **Govern**
   - Apply guardrails through:
     - **Policies**
     - **Compliance**
     - **Security Baselines**
   - Define a governance **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** to start simple and expand as needed.

6. **Manage**
   - Monitor performance, health, and cost.
   - Implement **operations management**, backups, disaster recovery, and incident response.

- Watch the **starter/overview video**
- Focus on understanding the **overall lifecycle**, not every detail
- Use it as a **guiding reference** throughout the cloud journey
