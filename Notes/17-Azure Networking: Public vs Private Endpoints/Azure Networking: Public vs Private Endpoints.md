# Azure Networking: Public vs Private Endpoints

## üîπ Overview

In Azure, services like Storage Accounts can expose two types of network access endpoints:

- **Public Endpoint** ‚Äì Accessible over the internet
- **Private Endpoint** ‚Äì Uses a private IP from a Virtual Network (VNet)

---

## üîπ Public Endpoints

### Characteristics

- Internet-routable address
- Can be accessed from anywhere with proper **authentication**
- Can be restricted using:
  - **IP-based firewall rules**
  - **Virtual Network rules (via Service Endpoints)**

### üî∏ Service Endpoints

- A Service Endpoint allows a **subnet** in a VNet to access a public endpoint securely.
- Still uses the public endpoint but **limits access** to a **known subnet**.

#### Example Configuration

1. Navigate to:  
   `Storage Account > Networking > Firewalls and virtual networks`
2. Select:  
   `Selected networks`
3. Add:
   - Allowed **IP ranges**
   - Allowed **VNets/subnets** using Service Endpoints

> üîê You still need authentication (e.g., Azure AD or shared access signature)

---

## üîπ Private Endpoints

### Characteristics

- Creates a **NIC** in a specified subnet of a VNet
- Assigns a **private IP** from that subnet
- Accesses the Azure service **privately**, not over the internet
- Works with:
  - Local VNet
  - Peered VNets
  - On-premises networks via **VPN** or **ExpressRoute**

### Benefits

- Fully private traffic path
- Can **disable public endpoint** entirely
- DNS integration available using **Azure Private DNS Zones**

### Private Endpoint Configuration

1. Go to:  
   `Storage Account > Networking > Private Endpoint Connections`
2. Click: `+ Add Private Endpoint`
3. Choose:
   - **Service type** (e.g., blob, file)
   - **VNet and subnet**
   - Enable **Private DNS integration**
4. Azure assigns an **internal IP** (e.g., `10.10.0.4`)  
5. DNS resolution is handled automatically to point FQDN to internal IP

> üìù DNS name stays the same (`mystorage.blob.core.windows.net`)  
> but resolves to the private IP internally

## üîπ DNS Considerations

- Required for TLS/SSL: DNS name must match certificate
- Use **Private DNS Zones** to manage name resolution for private endpoints

| Access Scope          | Public + VNet                             | Only inside VNet or connected network   |
| Restriction Options   | IP Firewall, Service Endpoints            | NSG + DNS + VNet boundaries             |

| Encryption Support    | Yes (TLS/SSL with public DNS name)        | Yes (DNS alias to private IP)           |
| Internet Disabled     | ‚ùå Optional                                | ‚úÖ Possible                              |

## üîπ Use Cases

- **Public Endpoint**: General workloads needing global access with firewall rules
- **Private Endpoint**: Secure workloads (e.g., finance, healthcare) needing isolated network access
