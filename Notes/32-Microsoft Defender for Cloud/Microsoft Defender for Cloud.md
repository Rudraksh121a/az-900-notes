## What is Microsoft Defender for Cloud?

Previously known as **Azure Security Center**, Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a **unified security management system** that provides:

- **Security posture visibility**
- **Threat protection** across:
  - Azure
  - Other clouds (e.g., AWS)
  - On-premises resources

It acts as a **security hub** and integrates with:
- **Azure Policy**
- **Azure Security Benchmark**
- **Action Groups**

---

## Key Functionalities

### 1. Secure Score
- A numerical value representing the **overall security posture**.
- Based on Azure Security Benchmark evaluations.
- Can be improved by following security **recommendations**.

#### Examples:
- Enabling MFA: High impact, increases score.
- Closing exposed management ports.
- Installing required agents or applying updates.

---

### 2. Recommendations
- Based on security scans across resources.
- Includes **quick fix** options for easy remediation.
- Ability to **exempt irrelevant recommendations** (e.g., using third-party tools).

---

### 3. Compliance View
- Assesses against the **Azure Security Benchmark**.
- Visual status: red (non-compliant), yellow (partial), green (compliant).
- Add support for other **regulatory standards** by enabling enhanced plans:
  - ISO 27001
  - NIST
  - PCI DSS, etc.

---

### 4. Enhanced Defender Plans

To enable additional security capabilities:
- Go to **Environment Settings**
- Enable **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Plans**

This provides:
- **Just-in-Time VM Access**
- **Threat Detection**
- **Advanced Compliance Dashboards**
- **Adaptive Application Controls**
- **Server EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)**

---

### 5. Just-In-Time (JIT) VM Access

- Temporarily opens **management ports (RDP/SSH)** only when needed.
- Access restricted by:
  - IP Address
  - Time window (e.g., 2 hours)
- Helps **reduce attack surface**.

---

### 6. Adaptive Application Controls
- Uses ML to detect and allow only commonly used applications.
- Blocks potentially **malicious or unknown software**.

---

### 7. Threat Protection
- Server EDR: Detects and responds to threats on VMs.
- Threat detection for supported **PaaS services**.
- Machine learning-based detection and alerting.

---

### 8. Alerts and Automation
- Generates alerts from:
  - Azure services
  - Defender plans
- Integrates with **Action Groups** (email, SMS, Logic Apps, etc.).
- Supports **automated responses** to threats.

---

## Integration with Hybrid & Multi-Cloud
- Extend Defender for Cloud to:
  - **AWS** accounts
  - **On-premises resources**
  - **Other cloud platforms**

Provides **unified security visibility and control**.
