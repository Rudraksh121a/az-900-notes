# Azure Cost Reduction Strategies

Azure provides many tools and methods to help reduce cloud costs. Below are practical strategies to lower your Azure bills without sacrificing performance or scalability.

---

## 1. Use Auto-Scaling
- **Scale dynamically** based on demand to avoid overprovisioning.
- Use services that support auto-scale:
  - VM Scale Sets
  - AKS (Kubernetes) – Cluster Autoscaler & HPA
  - App Service Plans

---

## 2. Adopt Serverless Where Possible
- Pay **only for execution time**.
- Best for event-driven workloads.
- Use:
  - Azure Functions
  - Logic Apps
  - Event Grid

---

## 3. Choose the Right SKU
- Match the **SKU (size/series)** with workload needs.
- Avoid overprovisioning resources (CPU, memory, etc.).

---

## 4. Shut Down & Deallocate Resources
- **Turn off** test/dev environments during non-working hours.
- Use **Auto-Shutdown** for VMs.

---

## 5. Delete Unused Resources
- Clean up after project/test completion.
- Use **Resource Groups** for easier lifecycle management.
- Avoid “VM sprawl” – don’t forget attached disks, NICs, etc.

---

## 6. Use the Right Storage Tiers
- Move infrequently accessed data to cheaper tiers:
  - **Hot** → Frequently used
  - **Cool** → Infrequently used
  - **Archive** → Rarely accessed
- Use **Lifecycle Management** to automate tier transitions.

---

## 7. Move from IaaS to PaaS
- Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) generally offers **better cost-efficiency** and reduced maintenance.

---

## 8. Use Tags for Cost Attribution
- Tag resources by:
  - **Business Unit**
  - **Environment** (dev, prod)
  - **Project / Cost Center**
- Enforce tags via **Azure Policy** to ensure accountability.

---

## 9. Use Azure Advisor
- Provides **personalized cost optimization recommendations**:
  - Right-sizing VMs
  - Identifying unused resources
  - Reserved Instance suggestions

---

## 10. Use Azure Reservations
- **Commit** to using resources (VMs, DBs, storage, etc.) for **1 or 3 years** to get up to **72% discount**.
- Best for **predictable workloads** (baseline usage).
- Pay upfront or monthly.

---

## 11. Use Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHUB)
- Reuse **existing on-prem licenses** (Windows, SQL, Red Hat, SUSE).
- Avoid paying again for licenses in Azure.
- Combine with **Reservations** for max savings.

---

## 12. Use Spot VMs
- Use **unused Azure capacity** at up to 90% lower cost.
- Ideal for:
  - Batch jobs
  - Flexible, **interruption-tolerant** workloads
- **Eviction risk**: VM may be deallocated when capacity is needed elsewhere.

| Strategy               | Description                                      | Best For                       |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Auto-Scaling           | Adjust resources dynamically                     | Variable workloads             |
| Serverless             | Pay per execution                                | Event-driven tasks             |
| Right SKU              | Match resource size to workload                  | All workloads                  |
| Auto-Shutdown          | Turn off unused resources                        | Test/Dev environments          |
| Azure Reservations     | Pre-pay for long-term usage                      | Predictable workloads          |
| Hybrid Benefit         | Reuse existing licenses                          | Enterprises migrating to Azure |
| Spot VMs               | Use spare capacity at low cost                   | Batch, dev, retryable tasks    |
| Azure Advisor          | Personalized cost recommendations                | All environments               |
| Lifecycle Mgmt         | Automate storage tier transitions                | Large storage workloads        |
| Tags + Policies        | Improve ownership, visibility, accountability    | Large organizations            |

# Pro Tip
Use the **Azure Pricing Calculator** and **TCO Calculator** to plan costs before deployment. Combine Reservations + Hybrid Benefit for maximum discount.
