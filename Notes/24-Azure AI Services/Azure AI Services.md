# Azure AI Services 

## Introduction to AI in Azure

Artificial Intelligence (AI) helps emulate human behavior using data.

### Common Use Cases:
- Identifying patterns
- Classifying or recognizing objects
- Predicting future outcomes based on historical data

### Types of AI:
- **AI**: Uses deep learning models inspired by neural networks in the human brain. No explicit programming required.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Involves training a model with existing data to apply predictions to new data.

## Azure Machine Learning

A full-featured platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. It is mainly used by data scientists who need complete control over the ML pipeline.

### Features:
- **Data Ingestion**: Load and prepare datasets.
- **Model Training**: Train models using different algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare multiple models to determine performance.
- **Pipelines**: Organize and automate workflows for experiments.
- **Deployment**: Make the trained model available as an API endpoint.

### Suitable For:
- Organizations with experienced data science teams
- Custom ML solutions requiring full control over model behavior
